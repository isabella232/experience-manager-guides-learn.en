# Glossary

The Glossary panel allows a map to be parsed. You can create a Glossary topic file and include it in a common Glossary map. This map can then be added to other maps. Using the Glossary makes it easier to consistently phrase information and provide better clarity to the reader.

Sample files that you may opt to use for this lesson are provided in the file [glossary.zip](assets/glossary.zip).

## Add a glossary entry to a topic

1. Navigate to the **Glossary** panel.

2. Drag and drop the entry from the **Glossary** panel to the desired location in your topic.

If the map contains Glossary entries and is properly configured, topics can be automatically updated to contain abbreviated form.

## Specify a Root Map

The correct Root Map must be selected to properly work with a glossary. When a Root Map finds Glossary Entries, they are shown in the Glossary panel.

1. With a topic open, select **Glossary** from the left panel.

2. Click the [!UICONTROL **User Preferences**] icon on the top toolbar.
