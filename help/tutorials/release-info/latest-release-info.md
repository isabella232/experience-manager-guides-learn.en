# [!DNL AEM Guides] Releases

[!DNL Adobe Experience Manager Guides] is an application deployed onto AEM. It is a powerful, enterprise-grade component content management solution (CCMS) which enables native DITA support in Adobe Experience Manager, empowering AEM to handle DITA-based content creation and delivery. 

AEM Guides packages are available in two modes - UUID build and non-UUID builds.

## UUID and Non-UUID builds
Key differences between the UUID and Non-UUID builds are as follows:

|  |UUID build |Non-UUID build |
|---|---|---|
|**Asset identification**|All assets are identified using the path of the asset in repository.|All assets are identified using their UUID (unique ID generated by the system when the asset was first uploaded).|
|**Reference creation**|All content references are created based on their paths.|All content references are created based on their UUID.|

### Benefits of UUID version 
* UUID installation is more performant:
    * References are path independent: The reference management system is aware of the linkages as the references are created based on UUIDs and not the paths.
    * Move/Update operations are efficient: The UUIDs remain same even if the assets move to another path in repository. So, no processing is required to patch the references between the assets on move/update operations.
* UUID version is forward-looking, as we are use this framework for the cloud setup of AEM Guides as well.


### Choose between the two versions
* If you are a new customer, we recommend you to use UUID version.
* If you are an existing customer, you can choose to move to UUID version as the migration from Non-UUID to UUID version is now possible. For more details, see the *Non-UUID to UUID content migration* section in the **Install and configure Adobe Experience Manager Guides.**

>[!NOTE]
>
>* Customers will need to decide between UUID and Non-UUID mode at the time of first setup (in case you need help, please connect with Customer Success Manager to help you make the decision based on your usecase).
>* When upgrading from one version of [!DNL AEM Guides] to a newer version, customers will need to ensure they pick the same mode (UUID / Non-UUID) to match their existing mode. A Non-UUID version should not be directly upgrade to a UUID version. Moving from Non-UUID version to UUID version would need content migration. 

**Upgrading Builds**

When you are upgrading from an older version to a newer version of [!DNL AEM Guides], you might need to execute migration scripts. Refer to Release Notes and version specific documentation for upgrade instructions.

Not all upgrade paths are directly supported. For example, direct upgrade to version 4.0 is possible only from version 3.8. 
If you are on a version prior to 3.8, then refer to your version-specific documentation for upgrade instructions [Help Archive](https://helpx.adobe.com/xml-documentation-for-experience-manager/archive.html).
Please reach out to your customer success manager to validate the upgrade path.
