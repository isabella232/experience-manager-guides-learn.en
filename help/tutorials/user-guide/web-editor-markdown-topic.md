Perform the following steps to create a Markdown topic from the Web Editor:

1.  Select a folder in the Repository View.
1.  Create **Markdown Topic** in one of the following ways:
    1.  Click **Create DITA File** icon on the top-right corner of the Repository Panel and then select **Markdown Topic** from the dropdown.
