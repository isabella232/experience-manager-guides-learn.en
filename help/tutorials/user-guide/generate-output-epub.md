# EPUB {#id205BED020YT}

You can create the EPUB preset from the map dashboard.

>[!NOTE]
>
> You can choose the method to generate HTML5 using the DITA-OT or FMPS \(if your system administrator has configured it\).

To open output presets for EPUB, click on a DITA map file, then click on Output Presets, and then click on the EPUB option. The following options are available for the EPUB Output:

| EPUB options | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Output Type | The type of output you want to generate. To generate EPUB output, choose the EPUB option. |
| Setting Name | Give a descriptive name for the EPUB output settings you are creating. For example, you can specify _Internal customers output_ or _end-users output_. |
| DITA-OT Command Line Arguments | Specify the additional arguments that you want DITA-OT to process while generating output. For details about the command-line arguments supported in DITA-OT, see [DITA-OT documentation](https://www.dita-ot.org/). |
| Generate EPUB Using | Select DITA-OT to generate the EPUB output. |
| Apply conditions using | Select one of the following options:<br><br>* None applied: Select this option if you do not want to apply any condition on the published output.<br>* DITAVal file: Select DITAVal file(s) to generate personalized content. You can select multiple DITAVal files using the browse dialog or by typing file path. Use the cross icon near the file name to remove it. DITAVal files are evaluated in the order specified, so the conditions specified in the first file take precedence over the matching conditions specified in later files. You can maintain the file order by adding or deleting files. If the DITAVal file is moved to some other location or is deleted, it is not automatically deleted from the map dashboard. You need to update the location in case files are moved or deleted. You can hover over the file name to see the path in the AEM repository where the file is stored. You can only select DITAVal files and an error is displayed if you have selected any other file type. FrameMaker Publishing Server doesn't support multiple DITAVAL files.<br>* Condition preset: Select a condition preset from the drop-down to apply a condition while publishing the output. The option is visible if you have added a condition present in the Condition Presets tab of the DITA map console. To know more about condition preset, see [Use condition presets](generate-output-use-condition-presets.html#id1825FL004PN). |
| Destination Path | The path within your AEM repository where the EPUB output is stored. |
| File Name | Specify the file name with which you want to save the EPUB output.<br><br>Note: If you do not provide a file name, then the DITA map's title is used to generate the final EPUB output file name. If the map does not have a title, then the DITA map's file name is used to name is the final EPUB output. The file name is sanitized using the rules configured in the system to handle any invalid character. |
| Transformation Name | Specify the type of output you want to generate. This is required if you want to generate output using your own custom plug-in, which is integrated in the DITA-OT plug-in. For example, if you want to generate XHTML output, specify `xhtml`. For a list of transformations available in DITA-OT, see [DITA-OT transformations (output formats)](http://www.dita-ot.org/2.3/user-guide/AvailableTransforms.html) in OASIS DITA-OT User Guide. |
| Clean DITA-OT Temporary Files | Select this option to clean the temporary files generated by DITA-OT. The location where DITA-OT stores temporary files can be found in the output generation log.<br><br>If you are experiencing errors while generating output through DITA-OT, you can deselect this option to retain the temporary files. You can then use those files to troubleshoot output generation errors. |
| Run Post Generation Workflow | When you choose this option, a new Post Generation Workflow drop-down list is displayed containing all workflows configured in AEM. You must select a workflow that you want to execute after completion of the output generation workflow.<br><br>Note: For more information about creating a custom post-output generation workflow, see _Customize post-output generation workflow_ in Install and configure Adobe Experience Manager Guides as a Cloud Service. |
| Use Baseline | If you have created a Baseline for the selected DITA map, select this option to specify the version that you want to publish.<br><br>See [Work with Baseline](generate-output-use-baseline-for-publishing.html#id1825FI0J0PF) for more detail. |
| Properties | Select the properties that you want to process as metadata. These properties are set from the Properties page of the DITA map or bookmap file. The properties that you select from the drop-down list are listed below the Properties field and are removed from the drop-down list. Once set, these properties are also copied into the topics within the map.<br><br>Note: You can also pass on the metadata to the output using DITA-OT publishing. For more details see, [Pass on the metadata to the output using DITA-OT](pass-metadata-dita-ot.html#id21BJ00QD0XA). |
