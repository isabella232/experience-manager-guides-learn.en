# Use Quick Generate panel to generate and view output {#id22AKE050F5L}

AEM Guides provides a **Quick Generate** panel integrated inside the Web Editor. This panel allows you to simultaneously generate the output for the output presets created for a DITA map. You can generate the output for one or more presets, or all presets created for a DITA map. You can also use the **Quick Generate** panel to later view the output generated for the presets.
