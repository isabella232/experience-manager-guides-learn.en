AEM Guides now comes with the feature to add smart tags. You can use XML Keyword Extract tool to extract smart tags. This tool uses artificial intelligence to understand the content and provide relevant keywords. You can use smart tags to improve your search engine optimization \(SEO\) and help the users to find your related content.

Perform the following steps to create smart tags:

1.  In the Assets UI, navigate to the topic for which you want to create the smart tags.
1.  Open the topic in Preview mode and select **Reprocess Assets** icon from the main toolbar.
1.  Select XML Keyword Extract to extract relevant keywords.
