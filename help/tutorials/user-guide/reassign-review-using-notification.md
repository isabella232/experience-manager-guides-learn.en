# Reassign review task using notification {#id21BNH03M0KS}

You can reassign a review task assigned to you, to another user who has been added to the same review project. The review task reassignment can be easily done from the review notification that is delivered in your inbox. However, as a reviewer, you can re-assign a review task only to individual users and not to user groups using notification.

Note that re-assignment can only be done for reviewer tasks and not owner tasks.

1.  **Reviewer task**: Any task which is assigned to a reviewer for a review.
1.  **Owner task**: A task which is created only for the owner. When you create and assign review task to a reviewer, the owner also receives an owner task with the name Close < review task name\> \(For example close-reviewtask1\) but this owner task cannot be reassigned to anyone.

Perform the following steps to re-assign a review task from the Inbox notification:

1.  Select the Review task notification in the Inbox.
1.  Select **Re-assign** icon on the top.
1.  Select the username to whom you want to re-assign the task.

    >[!IMPORTANT]
    >
    > The reviewer must have the permissions to reassign and should be a part of the user-administrator group.

1.  Select **Re-assign**.

Once the review task is reassigned, the Assignee column displays the name of the reviewer to whom the task has been reassigned.

The assigned reviewer receives a notification in the Inbox for the re-assigned review task.
