    The report page is divided into two parts:

    -   **Report Summary:**

        Lists the Average Content Reuse, which is calculated as Content Reuse Instances/Total Topic Count. This report takes into account all first level direct content references and topic references for calculation. The Content Reuse Instances is calculated as the sum total of values in the Number of Times Reused field. The topic that is most widely reused is also listed in the Report Summary. Clicking on the topic's link in the Most Reused Topic opens the topic's preview.

    -   **Details:**

        The Details section contains the following columns:

        Title
        :   The title of the topic. Clicking on the topic's title link opens the topic preview.

        UUID
        :   The universally unique identifier \(UUID\) of the file.

        Size
        :   Files size in bytes.

        Status
        :   The current state of the document - Draft, In-Review or Reviewed.

        Number of Times Reused
        :   Number of times the corresponding topic has been reused. This calculated as sum total of entries in Referenced By columns minus 1.

        Referenced By
        :   The topics in which the corresponding topic has been referenced. Here, only the direct \(first level\) references are considered. Multiple topics are separated by comma. The UUID of the referenced file is also mentioned in brackets.Clicking on the topic's title link opens the topic preview.
